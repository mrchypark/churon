# Product Overview

Churon is an R package that provides ONNX Runtime integration for machine learning inference, specifically designed for Korean text spacing models (kospacing). The package bridges Rust-based ONNX Runtime functionality with R through the extendr framework.

## Key Features
- ONNX model loading and inference
- Multiple execution provider support (CUDA, TensorRT, DirectML, OneDNN, CoreML, CPU)
- Korean text spacing model integration
- R-Rust interoperability through extendr

## Target Use Case
Korean natural language processing tasks requiring automatic spacing correction using pre-trained ONNX models.
