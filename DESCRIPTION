Description: Provides high-performance R bindings for ONNX Runtime, enabling
    efficient machine learning model inference. Written in Rust for memory safety
    and speed, the package supports cross-platform model execution with multiple
    execution providers (CPU, CUDA, CoreML, OneDNN). Includes comprehensive
    error handling and validation, with bundled MNIST example model for
    immediate testing and prototyping. Designed for production use with support for
    macOS (ARM64 only), Linux (x64/aarch64), and Windows (x64).
